# Design and release plans
Here is a list of short and long term goals as they relate to the mod. Things marked **WISHLIST** are currently outside the scope of my own abilities.

## Long term wishes and plans


### 1. Add and expand custom behavior for RECON, BANDIT and INSURGENT troops.
- _Recon troops_, always prefer hiding or escaping as a 'group action'
- _Bandits_, rush towards enemy in a drugged out stupor as a 'group action'
- _Insurgents_, may hide or collect weapons or vests based on distance to nearest enemy and house.

***

### 2. Add custom dangerFormation for vehicle crew and pilots
- Customised formations behaviour suitable for appropriate vehicles
- Counter measures or 'dodging' or 'jinking' suitable for class of vehicles
- Custom out-of vehicle combat behaviour-- hiding in bushes or running away

***

### 3.  Explore adding FSM improvements to driving AI for ground crew [WISHLIST]
- As a subset of the custom formation.fsm
- Change how vehicles keep in formation (this may come at the cost of ground crew being able to take cover!)
- Extra checks for crashing for these vehicles?

***

### 4.  Animations for panic state [WISHLIST]
- Four variants
- Standing (hands protecting head)
- Standing severe  (crouched down -- hands protecting head)
- Prone (weapon set aside; hands protecting head)
- Prone severe (hands protecting head -- longer lasting)
