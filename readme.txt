# LAMBS Danger
Expansion of vanilla Danger.fsm. Added are features which extend the enemy response and reaction to fire.

The goal is to make buildings part of the AI's available terrain. The AI will dynamically enter and clear buildings holding enemy soldiers. The nature of the the danger.fsm does not make these features a replacement for dedicated scripts however.

### Features
 * AI will move inside buildings
 * Perform suppressive fire (Vehicles will dismantle buildings)
 * Panic, with special effects
 * React, even when exact enemy position is unknown
 * React by hiding in the presence of powerful vehicles when without equipment to deal with it
 * Check dead bodies (Rearms if possible)
 * Tanks will react by rotating towards threats
 * Improved civilian reactions, hiding in buildings and checking dead bodies
 
### Settings
